# Job Site Web Scraper

This is just a small web scraper that parces through the job posting website and filters out any jobs that might require specific skills the individual is not knowledgeable in, thereby leaving only the specific job descriptions with skills that one is already familiar with. Afterwards, the code does a new search every ten (10) minutes and displays a new round of jobs in which the individual can read through a .txt file.
